// Do While Loops // 

let arr = ["milk", "bread", "cheese", "butter",];
let count = 0; // This code counts how many times this loop will repeat //
do {
console.log(arr[count++]);
} while (count < arr.length);

// Not used that often but there are times when a Do While Loop is needed >>> But in general a While Loop will suffice. //
